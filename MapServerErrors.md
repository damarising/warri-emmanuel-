    The people in charge of the !MapServer installation will have to check the .map file and database server. Email them the error and the URL which you used. The URL is probably visible at the top of your web browser as text which begins "http://...". Probably a double-click will highlight the URL, Control-C will copy it, and in your mail program you can use Control-V to paste it in.

       * The !MapServer would connect through 127.0.0.1, also called loopback: psql --host localhost -U readonlyuser --password -l                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  * Check for errors from the web server and in syslog for PostgreSQL errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
  * If there are no errors in syslog, you may need to configure the PostgreSQL server to log errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
    * Try locate postgresql.conf to find the file. It might be in /var/lib/pgsql/data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
    * The PostgreSQL configuration file has options for where to log and what to log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  * Maybe the database server is simply not listening to TCP requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
    * A netstat -an | grep 5432 should show TCP port 5432 has a listener.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
      * Read the netstat output closely, as a /tmp file with 5432 in the name is not a TCP port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
    * The database server configuration for TCP/IP is in the previously mentioned postgresql.conf file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
    * There also should be a 127.0.0.1 entry in the file pg_hba.conf to allow access by users through loopback TCP/IP connections.
