##Report #4
Reports #3 goes from July 5th to July 12th. First, my working example of the UTFGrid is up to date. It now returns a fully functional UTFGrid which returns the datas you choose in the mapfile.You can look to my example here: [Example](http://msgsoc.mapgears.com/projet_utfgrid/testhtmlmapserver.html)

###Week 6:
There will be a few changes from here. I'll try to evaluate how much time I spend on every points in my plan. This week I got a lot of work done. First, my mentor did a code review with me. We went through my code and looked for mistakes, points he wanted to change and he also gave me a lot of advices. With his advices, I made my datas accessible for my driver. I also updated my working example like I wrote higher.
There wasn't a lot of difficulties this week. Most of them were that I had to rework my code a bit and look for memory leaks. I work on a Mac and switching my code on the Unix server also got me a few problems.
###Plan:
Next week, I plan :
1. Get the UTF-8 encoding working. (half a day to a day of time)
2. Fix my pan problem with Openlayer. (2-3 days of time)
3. Change my driver and create my own simple instance of AGG using the params I need. (rest of week)
