This is so that we keep a trace for future reference of all bugfixes and changes that were made (why and how).</li><li>Please mark bugs ASSIGNED as soon as you start working on them</li><li>Please when marking a bug fixed include a comment describing the fix, the version of the software in which it was done, the SVN changeset number (e.g. r1234) and any other relevant information. This will just make our lives easier in a few months/years when questions come up about this issue.</li><li>When committing to SVN, please include the bug number in your SVN change log comment e.g. (#1234).</li><li>Keep documentation in mind when fixing/changing things: if you cannot update the documentation yourself then please create a documentation bug describing the new feature/change and which document(s) should be updated.</li></ul><p>The following query returns all currently open bugs that are tagged with the "5.2 release" target milestone:</p><p><a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;milestone=5.2+release">http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;milestone=5.2+release</a></p><p></p></div><h3 class="section">QA</h3>TODO...<br /><br /><p class="section"></p><div id="open-tasks" class="section"><h3>Open Tasks</h3><p>None.</p></div>
