                                                                                                                     
Work Done                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                     
1. Tried out some prototypes and wrote some example programs for support for circles and another symbols.            
                                                                                                                     
2. Research done on the way the new library Cairo ,using its well defined functions for SVG.                         
                                                                                                                     
3. Tried to draw some basic primitives like  simple lines, use fill and stroke operations.                           
                                                                                                                     
4. Aquired some knowledge on Cairo to support backends like PNG image, PDF file, SVG file  on a GTK window.          
                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                     
Plan for next week                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                     
1. Try to execute my own Svn copy of MapServer with some more changes.                                               
                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                     
2. Create sandbox  "svg-symbols"  in which I will do my work, Or need to wait until it is merged into the main trunk.
