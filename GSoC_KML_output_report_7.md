This week I synchronized code with main trunk. Old sandbox is deleted and new one based on MapServer trunk is created[[BR]]
Improved code for rendering labels and symbols[[BR]]                                                                       
Added new method startShape to rendererVTableObj to trigger placemark creating[[BR]]                                       
                                                                                                                           
Next week plan:[[BR]]                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                           
Modify mapdraw.c file to ensure symbols and labels coordinates are transformed using renderer transformShape method[[BR]]  
Study code related to KMZ (KML zipped) output[[BR]
