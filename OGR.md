OGR is a library allowing the reading and writing of a variety of vector formats using a geometry model based on the !OpenGIS Simple Features specification. It is integrated into !MapServer as a way of reading a variety of vector formats.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Its use in !MapServer is detailed in the OGR HOWTO:

OGR is maintained primarily by Frank Warmerdam, but the OGR integration into !MapServer is done by Daniel Morissette.
