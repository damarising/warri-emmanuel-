Based on our experience with the other 4.x releases, we will plan for 3 betas over a 6 weeks period after the code freeze. This would lead us to a final release in early June:

In order to facilitate querying the bugzilla database for bugs that still need to be addressed for this release, we try to stick to the following conventions:                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
* Bugs to be addressed for this release must have their target milestone set to "4.6 release"                                                                                                                                                                    
* Bugs/Enhancements? that can't make it in this release but that we may want to address at a later time should be marked with the "FUTURE" target milestone with a comment explaining that the bug is postponed and if possible a quick analysis                 
* The target milestone on a bug should be set by the developers (bug owners) and not by the users (reporters).                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Other good practices when dealing with bugs:                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
* Please file bugs for any non-trivial bugfix or change to the software. This is so that we keep a trace for future reference of all bugfixes and changes that were made (why and how).                                                                          
* Please mark bugs ASSIGNED as soon as you start working on them                                                                                                                                                                                                 
* Please when marking a bug fixed include a comment describing the fix, the version of the software in which it was done, and any other relevant information. This will just make our lives easier in a few months/years when questions come up about this issue.
* When committing to CVS, please include the bug number in your CVS change log comment.                                                                                                                                                                          
* Keep documentation in mind when fixing/changing things: if you cannot update the documentation yourself then please create a documentation bug describing the new feature/change and which document(s) should be updated.
