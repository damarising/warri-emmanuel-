A few years ago I spent some time researching the relative merits of two popular web-based map servers, !MapServer and !ArcIMS. I posted the summary results of that research to a couple of places with a note saying that anybody who wanted the full results should contact me. Much to my surprise three and half years later I still get asked for them every month or two.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Since it's been so long, maybe somebody should review the situation and see what has changed -- and what hasn't. It won't be me. My job has pulled me in other directions, we aren't running any kind of mapserver anymore so my involvement in this question is minimal.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Anyway, the full respondant text is available at http://yukongis.ca/bin/view/Main/MapserverVsArcIMS. Feel free to pull whatever you want from that page and rework/update it here, which is actually the more appropriate place. I didn't want to just dump it here as the full text is about 100k.

A few weeks I ago asked mapserver-users, esri-l, comp.infosystems.gis, and comp.soft-sys.gis.esri for comparitive comments on !MapServer and !ArcIMS.

All respondants felt !MapServer's support (via the user community) and documentation is much more useful than ArcIMS?'. It was noted that often questions re:!ArcIMS went completely unanswered. A couple of people made the point that although Mapserver's documentation is better there are still some gaping holes; it is expected the newly formed documentation committee and mailing list will help address this issue.

Most everybody said that !MapServer is faster* although theoretically this should not be the case since Mapserver is a CGI while !ArcIMS is a Java app. (*nobody claimed !ArcIMS is faster, just not everybody made a speed comparison)                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Those that made reliabilty comparisons felt that !ArcIMS is still buggy and undependable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The one* plus !ArcIMS seems to have over !MapServer is the GUI that allows development of the interface and equivalent to map files. There is an !ArcView extension and an Arc AML which make producing Mapserver map files easier but they are still in development. There is also talk of developing a standalone map builder but I'm not sure how far along that project is yet. (*where the problem domains overlap)      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
There were incidental threads comparing !MapServer to !MapXtreme, and JShape where !MapServer also came out on top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Thanks to everybody who responded and a note to those who didn't: I'm quite willing to do this again. I'm disappointed nobody came to bat for !ArcIMS. I was hoping to be able to summarize a broader range of opinions. Than again, maybe it is simply true that !MapServer is better than !ArcIMS.
