# Google Summer of Code Ideas

OSGeo has been accepted as a mentor organization for GSoC 2017, see http://www.osgeo.org/node/1772

It helps student developers to contribute to open source software - https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/

See the OSGeo page for more details: https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2017_Administrative

The timeline for 2017 is:

* February 27 - March 20	Potential student participants discuss application ideas with mentoring organizations
* March 20 Student application period opens
* April 3 Student application deadline
* May 30	Coding officially begins!

In previous years the MapServer project has mentored students for the following features:

* 2013 - GSoC UTF Grid implementation - https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/wiki/GSoC-UTF-Grid-implementation
* 2009 - KML Output - https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/wiki/GSoC_KML_output
* 2009 - SVG Symbol Support - https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/wiki/GSoC_SVG_Symbols

Please add any ideas below. Even if it is not possible this year it could be useful to keep track of possible future features. 
Note each idea needs 2 mentors, even if not proposing mentorship please list possible new features for discussion. 


## Ideas List

* Apply patches to the TinyOWS project
* An online MapFile validator in a similar style to http://jsonlint.com using the https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mappyfile/ library on the back-end
* An interactive "gallery" showcasing all the features on MapServer as part of the online docs
