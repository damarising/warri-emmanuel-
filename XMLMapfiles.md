For the release of MapServer 5.6, a XML schema has been defined to encode mapfiles in XML format, this is discussed in more details in [http://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-51.html MS RFC 51].                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
MapServer 5.6 does not implement direct support for reading and writing that XML mapfile format, but a XSLT is included with the distribution to convert an XML mapfile into a regular mapfile usable with MapServer.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
We hope that the ability for outside contributors to build Mapfile Editors will be facilitated by the existence of this XML mapfile format. If XML mapfile editors become available and popular, then we may consider implementing direct read/write support for the XML format in MapServer in a future release.

If you are using a XML editor like XMLSpy, you can easily specify the XML schema used to validate your current XML document. Furthermore, those editors will provide XML completition by listing allowed tags/attributes, automatic validation and more..                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
If you prefer, you can also use a normal text editor. On Linux, there is a few tools to validate a XML file with its schema. On Ubuntu, you can do the following command:

These processors don't seem to support the use of the http://exslt.org/ xslt extension. xsltproc is also available for Windows: http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html
