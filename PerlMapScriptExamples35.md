    create_tileindex.pl creates a tileindex shapefile for the usage of tiled georeferenced images in mapserver. It needs as arguments the name of the tileindex shapefile to be created. Please specify no extension for the tileindex argument! The argument for the image extension can be omitted, it defaults to 'tif'. Additionally the imagedir can be given, it defaults to the current directory. When the verbosity argument is given, the names of the processed files are printed. Two or more -v's on the commandline additionally print the coordinates of the images.

    There are fairly major changes in Mapserver4.0+, styleObj, colorObj, etc. and many new methods thanks to Sean Giles so I figured it's time for a new section of examples. My experience, with little testing, was that mapscript4.0.2 was not quite ready for prime time, missing some of the newer methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    One major thing to watch out for, Sean made use of Perl's automatic garbage collection, creating destructors for all objects so there is no need to call any free() methods. In fact $imageObj->free() causes a core dump. The free() methods will be going away in the near future.

    Just a 4.2 version of query_points2.pl, above. Shows how to create a dynamic point layer which responds to queryByPoint() and will return your numeric database key values and illustrates the use of the new styleObject and the new setRGB() methods and the new $layerObj->getNumResults().
