Everybody recognizes the need to be able to hide layers from a given mapfile from some or all OGC Web Service (OWS) requests. Some tickets about this are as old as 6 years old. Unfortunately we have been unable to come up with a solution because there are several angles to consider in approaching the problem.

One needs the ability to hide tileindex layers to all OGC services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 2. In a WMS mapfile where multiple scale-dependent layers are in a common group, we want only the group to appear in GetCapabilities and not the individual layers. However the layers should not be completely turned off since we want them to be visible in GetMap and queryable with GetFeatureInfo when the group is selected. This use case is common for WMS and may (or may not) apply to other OGC services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 3. One may want to offer a given layer via WMS but not via WFS (or any combination of services). In other words, we need the ability to select in which OGC services a given layer is exposed.

Not about hiding a full layer, but setting the ability to say that one wants a certain layer to return the geometry as gml in a wms-getfeatureinfo-response (at this moment it is never returned)

Maybe the most risky one concerning interoperability. MapServer gets a new metadata key 
```[service]_disable_request```. Each request type listed in this key will not be processed for the given service. This metadata can be applied on layer sections but also on the web section. In the latter case, the given requests types are disabled for any layers in a map file and for a mapscript object respectively. Disabled requests types may not appear in the GetCapabilities document. Layers which have the GetCapabilities request type disabled may not appear in the capabilitiy documents <Layer> subtree. Handling of the GetCapabilities request type and others may be an inconsistency in this solution. The idea is that a capability document has to be offered as long as the service type is 'alive' – even if any layers and all other request types are disabled.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In order to disable a service (hence OWS exception when called), the value 
```all``` may be used. In this case the metadata has to be applied in the web section. Having {{{[service]_disable_request 'all'}}} applied on the layer level, it will only disable all requests types for this single layer. This behaviour has to be well documented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
This is probably the most flexible solution to combine request rules for different service types on a single layer. In order to ''enable'' a service the document pre-conditions (metadata, data types, settings) still apply. The 
```all``` value in the web section is only intended to disable a service type if it is enabled for some reason (e.g. not carefully configured) and/or so that the user can be sure a service type is disabled.

Combination of solution 1 and 2. MapServer uses the 
```SERVICE WMS|WFS|WCS``` setting in order to enable a service type for a given layer (or other way around to disable a service type?). A second new setting {{{DISABLE GetFeatureInfo|GetStyles}}} (or {{{ENABLE}}}?) controls which request types have to be served. In this solution enabled/disabled requests types apply to all enabled SERVICE types.
