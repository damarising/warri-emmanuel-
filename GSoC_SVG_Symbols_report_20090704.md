1. Initiated a discussion with the developers regarding my best approach to follow.                          
                                                                                                             
2. Started working on my RfC-request for comments, i need to clearly summarize the path i am going to follow.
                                                                                                             
3. RFC works as a basic documentation until the main docs are prepared.                                      
                                                                                                             
4. Tried to cover everything i learned, and the things i need to do in my project In the RFC.                
                                                                                                             
                                                                                                             
Plan for coming week                                                                                         
                                                                                                             
1. Put forward my first draft of RFC on the MapServer's -dev list and request for votes.                     
                                                                                                             
2. Depending on the RFC's credibility ,if everyone agree with my approach then i should start of!!           
                                                                                                             
3. I will take suggestions from my mentor and dev's to make the RFC more specific about my project.
