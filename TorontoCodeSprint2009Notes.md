 * A draft RFC is at http://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-51.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 * There are concerns about the use of the CWXML library and the benefits of a binary encoded format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 * The need we are trying to address is the ability to build MapFile Editors that would be facilitated by the existence of a XML mapfile format (since the current mapfile format makes it impossible to write a forward-compatible parser)                                                                                               
 * There are concerns about having to support another set of parsing functions. Just keeping the existing mapfile.x read/write functions in sync is already a challenge, so adding another set of reader/writer functions for XML will just make this worse.                                                                              
 * Conclusion: After discussion, it was decided that for the time being we should '''develop a XML schema and a XSLT to convert from XML to text mapfile'''. If the new XML format takes off then we may consider implementing support for it directly in MapServer in a future release.

 * An itemObj structure has already been added to mapprimitive.h. We agree that this is the way to go, the C code should be updated to use itemObj instead of the array of itemnames, etc.

 * What can we do about this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 * Conclusion: at least moving the OWS-related metadata to a separate OWS/END block (hashtable) would help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 * We'll need to maintain backwards compatibility for existing mapfiles that have their ows_* metadata in the METADATA/END block. The way it would be handled is that if a OWS/END block is present that it takes priority and all lookups happen in that hashtable only, otherwise we fallback on the metadata hashtable for all lookups.
 * A RFC will be required for this.
