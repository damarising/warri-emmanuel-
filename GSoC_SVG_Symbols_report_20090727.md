1. I tried adding parser so that it calls my parsing function when it comes across the SVG part in the Mapfile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2. I have been looking at the techniques in generating the image file from the SVG specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Plan for next week:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
1. Resolve the problem of storing data.whether to use pixmaps or someother thing on my own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2. Write the first working result using SVG_test.cpp present in the sources of AGG. Implement a SVG parser using AGG/SVG Viewer and make it render into an in-memory pixmap.                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Bottle neck:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
I have been looking at the techniques in generating the image file from the SVG specification and have run into the following problems:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
1. In the MapServer code, where is the Mapfile getting parsed? I want to add to the parser so that it calls my parsing function when it comes across the SVG part in the Mapfile.                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2. How exactly do I store the SVG data? You mentioned pixmaps, but the concept is very generic. Is there some specific format that MapServer already uses or should  I be coming up with my own format (eg. a 2D array of int's)?                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3. Once the pixmap is created, we had discussed about storing different versions of the SVG symbol based on orientation and size. Do we want this to be on demand (the user requests a new size or orientation, so we generate one and add it to the cache) or is it done automatically in the beggining for all possible sizes and rotations (seems like a bad idea!).
