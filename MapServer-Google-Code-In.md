* description/vision: It is not a vector image and is meant to be small since it is a sticker, so you will probably have to zoom out a little. The name gave me inspiration for how I wanted it to look. Mapserver sounds kind of old school when I think about it, so I decided to go with a retro/grainy kind of look.
