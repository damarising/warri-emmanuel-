            This is my first week report. Just a short introduction:I am Kiran 3rd year undergraduate at Jawaharlal Technological University(JNTU). My project this year is to add support for reading SVG symbols in the existing Mapserver rendering API. Here is a wiki page which contains some useful information such as this email and a link to the abstract,project summary etc. http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/wiki/GSoC_SVG_Symbols .  
 Anyways i have been doing some research on the present API and how to keep it flexible and friendly to the libraries we want to use in SVG support. The thing we need to do is ,implement an svg subset that maps to the existing  mapserver renderer API ,Currently the rendering API probably only has point, line, ellipse, polygon, and text. We need to add support for circles,distorted figures etc.
