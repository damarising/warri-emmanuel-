##Report #7

Reports #7 goes from July 27th to August 2nd. My example is up to date. Just a few additions to OpenLayers and it should be a completely functional UTFGrid generated with MapServer. [Exemple](http://msgsoc.mapgears.com/projet_utfgrid/testhtmlmapserver.html)

###Week 9:

This week, my whole plan changed. I didn't do the renderSymbols function et LABELS outputOption due to upcoming changes on how theses will be rendered. It took me one day but I completely remade my pixel and removed most of its useless code. Then, I started to work on docs necessary for a release for half a day. The rest of the week, I worked on fixing bugs in my driver. I am currently working on OpenLayers, i'm adding the necessary support for UTFGridWMS. This week difficulties came from fixing bugs. I had a hard time finding where they came from. I'm not used to JavaScript so working on OpenLayers is also causing me trouble.

###Plan:

1.  Finish UTFGrid support with OpenLayers. (1 days)
2.  Generate the UTFGrid doc. (2 days)
3.  Prepare the UTFGrid release. (1 day)
4.  Start fixing bugs that people finds. (rest of week)
