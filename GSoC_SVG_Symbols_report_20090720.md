1. Worked on AGG/SVG rendering specifics,will be clear on all the rendering specifics of AGG/SVG and document them in the RFC.                                       
                                                                                                                                                                     
2. Studied some stuff about how exactly we need to generate a pixmap (cache).                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                     
3. Using the preloaded examples ,i was successfully able to execute AGG/SVG and MapServer .                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                     
Plan for coming week:                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                     
1. Test all possibilities of various attributes of SVG provided by AGG.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                     
2. By the end of the week i can publish the next version of the RFC with more precise information on coding plan.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                     
3. Need to understand more on how the concept of Pixmap is used in MapServer. Implement a SVG parser using AGG/SVG Viewer and make it render into an in-memory pixmap.
