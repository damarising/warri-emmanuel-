##Report #6

Reports #6 goes from July 20th to July 26th. I didn't modify my example this week. I will update it once my renderSymbols function are done. That should be up to date by tuesday 30th evening.

###Week 8:

This week, I added a lot of function to my driver. First of all, I fixed my UTF8 encoding problem I had last week. It took me about 2 days and a half to do. Then, I added the DUPLICATES formatOption to my utfgridRenderer. This function allow the user to choose not to remove duplicates from the lookup table. That part took me about half a day. Also, I made the UTFRESOLUTION formatOption fully functional. It no longer modify the map. The modification are now made locally in the driver. This took me about half a day to do. Finally, I am currently working on the renderSymbols function. There's 4 of them and I got 2 working. The 2 others are still WIP. There wasn't a lot of difficulties this week. They mostly came from the UTF-8 encoding. I also got trouble on how to get my symbols data into the renderer but my mentor showed me how to do.

###Plan:

1.  Finish the renderSymbols function. (2 days)
2.  Update my working example. (not much)
3.  Add the LABELS outputOption. (1 day to 2 days)
4.  Start fixing bugs. (rest of week)
