##Report #8

Reports #8 goes from August 3rd to August 9th. As usual, you can find my up to date working example here: [Exemple](http://msgsoc.mapgears.com/projet_utfgrid/testhtmlmapserver.html)

###Week 10:

I started the week by making the docs for my new feature. It was fairly simple and took me 1 day instead of the 2 I expected. Then, I worked on a bug in my driver for a complete day. There was a rendering problem
it was easy to fix once I found it. Finally, I worked most of the week on the OpenLayers patch. It is now complete and I made a pull request on their Git. I also sent a message to both devs and users mailing list about the new UTFGrid driver so that I can start getting feedback from people.
Most of the difficulties this week came from the OpenLayers patch. Working in a library that I didn't know in a language i'm not at ease was rough. But now I feel comfortable with JavaScript. Making the docs and fixing my bug were nothing too hard.

###Plan:

1.  Start fixing bugs that people finds. (Unknown)
2.  Start making the tiling function for UTFGrid. (Depends on feedback)
