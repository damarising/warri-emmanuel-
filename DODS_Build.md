Unpack these under a common directory, for instance /u. They will then all unpack into a /u/DODS tree. Build them by cd'ing into /u/DODS and doing a "configure" and "make". This will place the various libraries and include files in /u/DODS/lib and /u/DODS/include. Don't worry about failures building ncview and other applications. We don't need those.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
If you are building on a platform that requires the -fPIC flag for code to be included in a shared library (such as Solaris), make sure you provide it when configuring the DODS code. Just the the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables to -fPIC before running the DODS configure.

Next download, configure and build GDAL with DODS support. The DODS support is in constant work, so download a nightly snapshot of the GDAL source, not the 1.1.9 release. When you configure it, use the --with-dods-root=/u/DODS (or whatever path you used).                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
You shouldn't need to do anything special with !MapServer. All the magic is in GDAL/OGR.
