4. Aquired some more knowledge on Cairo to support backends like PNG image, PDF file, SVG file on a GTK window.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                             
5. Generated basic SVG files using cairo,researching circle styling.

1. Confirm my present status and knowledge with my mentor and start of the coding !                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                             
2. Create sandbox "svg-symbols" in which I will do my work, Or need to wait until it is merged into the main trunk. If possible delay it until we come into a final decision.
                                                                                                                                                                             
3. Participate in Discussions with dev's on which approach we need to go,avoid approaches which may be of heavy weight
