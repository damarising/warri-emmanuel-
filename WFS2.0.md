This page is currently a parking place for collecting information and thoughts on what must be done to provide OGC Web Feature Service 2.0.0 (also ISO 19142) support within !MapServer. It is still at an early stage: if you have more information then please add it! Once the requirements are clear, a RFC will be prepared.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
!MapServer already supports WFS1.1, so this page is largely focussed on the differences between this and WFS2.0, and what impact this has on !MapServer.

''This goes beyond the joins currently supported by !MapServer (which are 1:n from spatial objects to attributes/non-spatial objects) to include spatial and attribute joins between layers.
