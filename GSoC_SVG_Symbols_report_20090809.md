1. Worked on the Final RFC.                                                                               
                                                                                                          
2. Modified the parser to recognize a new type SVG.                                                       
                                                                                                          
3. Modified symbolObj structure to store path of SVG files specified.                                     
                                                                                                          
4. Added skeleton cases to all rendering functions.                                                       
                                                                                                          
'''                                                                                                       
Plan for next week :'''                                                                                   
                                                                                                          
1. Started working with createBrushFromSVG() function.                                                    
                                                                                                          
2. Publish the final version of RFC by this weekend, so that every user can understand the project's plan.
                                                                                                          
3. Integrate the AGG,SVG parser into MapServer code and have it generate a pixmap.
