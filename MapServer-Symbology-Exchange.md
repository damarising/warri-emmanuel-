Share and enjoy symbolsets and URLs to cartographic icons. Would you like Google-esque streets, or to find an airplane logo that doesn't have white crud around it? Do you have a better railroad track than anyone else?                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Making a two-color square is easy, but a two-color star looks crummy unless you have the sizes just right -- it took me hours to make up a set of icons at 6 sizes apiece. And I knew I wasn't alone. So welcome to the Symbology Exchange!        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Please post a comment to the appropriate "sub-howto" showing your icon(s) and the code to generate it. Thanks for sharing, thanks for searching!
